= Configuring Unicorn for Rails

The astute observer will notice the lack of variables in vlad-unicorn to set
the Rails environment or a path prefix for the app (the +unicorn_rails+
command allows this with with the +--env+ and +--path+ options, respectively).
Both of these can just as easily be done by setting the appropriate
environment variables in the unicorn.rb config file, like so:

    ENV['RAILS_ENV'] = 'production'
    ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] = '/prefix'
